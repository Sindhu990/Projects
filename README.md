      Simple Linear Regression: Predicting Car Prices Using Python



I built a small machine-learning model to understand how car size influences market price. Even though it's a simple dataset, the workflow reflects the essential steps used in real data-science projects.

* Data Creation & Visualization - Constructed a clean dataset using Python dictionaries and converted it into a Pandas DataFrame.

* Train-Test Split - Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) to evaluate model performance.

* Feature Scaling - Used StandardScaler to normalize the car-size feature, ensuring the model trains efficiently.

* Model Training - Applied Linear Regression from scikit-learn to learn the relationship between car size and price.

* Model Visualization _ Plotted the training data along with the regression line to visually confirm the trend.
